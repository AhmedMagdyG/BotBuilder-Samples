This sample demonstrates how to sub-class the Dialog class to create
different bot control mechanism like simple slot filling.

# To try this sample
- Clone the repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-samples.git
    ```
- In a terminal, navigate to javascript_nodejs/21.custom-dialogs
    ```bash
    cd javascript_nodejs/21.custom-dialogs
    ```
    - Point to the MyGet feed 
    ```bash
    npm config set registry https://botbuilder.myget.org/F/botbuilder-v4-js-daily/npm/
    ```
- Install modules and start the bot
    ```bash
    npm i & npm start
    ```
- To reset registry, you can do
    ```bash
    npm config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org/
    ```

# Testing the bot using Bot Framework Emulator
[Microsoft Bot Framework Emulator](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-emulator) is
a desktop application that allows bot developers to test and debug their bots on localhost
or running remotely through a tunnel.

- Install the Bot Framework Emulator from [here](https://aka.ms/botframework-emulator)

## Connect to bot using Bot Framework Emulator V4
- Launch Bot Framework Emulator
- File -> Open Bot Configuration and navigate to javascript_nodejs/21.custom-dialogs
- Select custom-dialogs.bot file

# Custom Dialogs

Botbuilder provides a built-in base class called `Dialog`. By subclassing Dialog, developers
can create new ways to define and control dialog flows used by the bot. By adhering to the
features of this class, developers will create custom dialogs that can be used side-by-side
with other dialog types, as well as built-in or custom prompts.

This example demonstrates a custom Dialog class called `SlotFillingDialog`, which takes a
series of "slots" which define a value the bot needs to collect from the user, as well
as the prompt it should use. The bot will iterate through all of the slots until they are
all full, at which point the dialog completes.
